Provide a Calculator API to determine affordability and financial forecasting  

This API is envisioned to guide first time asset buyers. The main premise is to determine affordibility based on an income value. A secondary feature which this api will provide is to provide financial forcasting in terms of alternate options to invest a portion of the affordibility figure.
